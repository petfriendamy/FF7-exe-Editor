# FF7.exe Editor
This is a tool for modding Final Fantasy VII game data that can only be found in the EXE file. This includes the following:
* Cait Sith and Vincent's initial data
* Default character names as seen on the naming screen
* Item prices
* Shop inventories

This tool can create direct edits to the EXE file, as well as generating Hext files for use with the [7th Heaven mod manager](https://github.com/tsunamods-codes/7th-Heaven).

Special thanks to titeguy3 for his work on the original shop editor.
